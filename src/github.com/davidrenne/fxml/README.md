[![godoc](https://img.shields.io/badge/godoc-reference-blue.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/xrfang/fxml)

This package provides a simple parser which reads a XML document and output a tree structure, which does not need a pre-defined `struct`, hence the name **"FreeStyle"**.

See [godoc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/xrfang/fxml) for more information.
